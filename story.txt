One day BMW and Porsche was having a date at Raesfeld Flughafen. 
They ordered some bratwurst to eat and watched cars drive down the Klimaanlage.
Suddenly a Hund snatch their klimaanlage.
That, as you could imagine took a lot of energey, the hund whined and puffed. 
Since they were still hungry they then ordered some gebaeck from the baeckerei.
The same hund, again, snatch their food again, their precious gebaeck.
It was a sunny day in Berlin, perfect day to have some Apfelkuchen at the Biergarten.
