One day BMW and Porsche was having a date at Raesfeld Flughafen. 
They ordered some bratwurst to eat and watched cars drive down the Klimaanlage.
Suddenly a Hund snatch their klimaanlage.
That, as you could imagine took a lot of energey, the hund whined and puffed. 
Since they were still hungry they then ordered some gebaeck from the baeckerei.
The same hund, again, snatch their food again, their precious gebaeck.
It was a sunny day in Berlin, perfect day to have some Apfelkuchen at the Biergarten.
They also needed to buy clothes, specifically a pair of Lederhose and a Dirndel.
Then, they took the Hauptstrasse back to their home with Klimaanlage.
When they got back home, they found an Apfelkuchen had appeared on the counter.
They had apple pies and cookies as the sun set.
They felt that their luck had turned out good so the next day the went to the biergaten.
And these Gebaeck had great tastes!
